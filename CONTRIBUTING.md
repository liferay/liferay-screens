# Liferay Screens Contribution Guide

Before contributing to Liferay Screens, make sure that you have done the following:

1. Read the architecture tutorial for the platform you're contributing to:

    - [Architecture of Liferay Screens for Android](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-android)
    - [Architecture of Liferay Screens for iOS](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/architecture-of-liferay-screens-for-ios)

2. Read the coding style guide for the platform you're contributing to:

    - [Liferay's Guide to Swift Style and Code Conventions](ios/swift-style-guide.md)
    - Android coding style guide is coming soon!

3. Sign up for [our issue tracker](https://issues.liferay.com/secure/Signup!default.jspa) and go to the [Liferay Screens page](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LMW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel).

4. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-screens/).

## Making Contributions

Follow these steps if you know the feature that you want to add, and how to add it:

1. Add your new feature as a Story in [our issue tracker](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LMW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). Describe your feature's purpose, benefits, and details. Also make sure to associate your feature with one specific Epic.

2. Create a branch for your feature.

3. When you make commits, prefix the commit message with LMW-xx, where xx is the Story number in the issue tracker. Try to arrange your commits in such a way that revisions are easier to make. 

4. Push your branch to your repository and create a pull request to the liferay-screens `master` branch.

## Determining Your Contributions

What happens when you want to make a contribution, but you're not sure about it, or you don't know how to implement it? No problem! One thing you can do is open a thread in [our forum](https://www.liferay.com/community/forums/-/message_boards/category/42706063). We're always happy to discuss new ideas.

If you have a good idea for a feature but don't know how to implement it, you can add a Feature Request to [our issue tracker](https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LMW/?selectedTab=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin:summary-panel). When doing so, be sure to describe the benefits of the feature and why you think it's useful. We'll then review and prioritize it.
